\newline \newline 
This letter is to express my interest in applying for the Software Engineer position at MCB. This opportunity is very appealing and I believe that my experience and education will make me a great candidate for this role.\newline

I am currently working as a Consultant at Aberdeen Services where I have had the opportunity to not only learn new technologies and deliver software with minimal supervision but also work with clients and external collaborators directly. I was also an intern at PricewaterhouseCoopers where I was able to hone my time management and communication skills while producing intuitive and appealing software.\newline

The key strengths that I possess for success in this position include, but are not limited to the following:\newline
• Ability to grasp new concepts quickly and willingness to learn\newline
• Strong communication skills\newline
• Effective time management\newline
• Problem solving and critical thinking\newline

I hope that you will find my application intriguing enough to warrant an interview, as I am confident that I could be a great addition to your team. I connect with your mission to "help individuals and corporates achieve their goals while simplifying banking through technology and excellent customer service" and I am very excited about this opportunity.\newline

I have included my contact details in this letter as well as my resume. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.
